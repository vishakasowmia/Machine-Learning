# machine-learning

Here in this repository, I have applied different technique of Machine Learning from EDA to Unsupervised Learning for different Problem statements. And even I have explored of the deep learning techniques.

## Installation
For Exploratory analysis, I have used Matplotlib.
```bash
pip install Matplotlib

```
Marjorly I have used scikit-learn for Machine learning.
Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install sklearn.

```bash
pip install scikit-learn

```
For Deep Learning Tensorflow

```bash
pip install tensorflow

```
